Cookies are safe since they can only store the information that was placed in their place by the browser, which is information that the user has entered in the browser or that is included in the page request. They cannot execute code and cannot be used to access your computer.

Cookies are essential for the operation of the internet, providing countless advantages in the provision of interactive services, facilitating navigation and usability of a website.

What types of cookies exist?

Below, we provide more information to better understand the different types of cookies that can be used:

-   Based on expiration:

Session cookies: are temporary cookies that remain in the browser's cookie file until the website is exited. They are often used to analyze traffic patterns on the website. In the long run, this allows for a better user experience by improving content and facilitating its use.

Persistent cookies: are stored on the device and the website reads them every time a new visit is made. Despite their name, a persistent cookie has a specific expiration date. The cookie will stop working after that date, which can range from a few minutes to several years. They are generally used to facilitate the different services that websites offer.

-   Based on who manages them:

First-party cookies: are sent and managed by a team or domain belonging to the website itself that you are visiting.

Third-party cookies: are sent and managed by a third party that is not the web publisher itself. They come from another server. For example, those used by social networks, or by external content such as Google Maps.

-   Based on what purpose the cookies serve, we can distinguish between:

Technical cookies: are those that allow the user to navigate through a web page and use the different options or services that exist on it, such as controlling traffic, identifying the user's session, accessing parts of restricted access, remembering the elements that make up an order, making a request for registration or participation in an event, using security elements during navigation, storing content for the dissemination of videos or sound or sharing content through social networks.

Analytical cookies: are those that allow the responsible party to track and statistically analyze the behavior of users on the websites to which they are linked. They are used to measure website activity and to create user navigation profiles for those sites, in order to make improvements based on the analysis of data on how users use the service. They are processed by us and/or by third parties. These cookies collect anonymous/disassociated information from the user, such as the number of users and the time spent, how often the site is visited, the user's origin, keywords, etc. This allows us to improve the range of products and services we offer.

Advertising cookies: are those that, either processed by us or by third parties, allow us to manage the offer of advertising spaces on the web page as effectively as possible, adapting the content of the advertisement to the content of the requested service or to the use made of our website.
